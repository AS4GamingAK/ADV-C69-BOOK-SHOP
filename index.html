                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
                    We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities. </p>

                <p>This book is probably one of the best books I have read. I was always wondering what would happen next – some parts were filled with fear and emotion and some filled with action. My favorite part of the book was when Percy fights Ares, the god of war. I could not put this book down. Wherever I went this book came with me. Rick Riordan Is a very good author and I love reading his books. I can't wait to start reading the next one. </p>
